# My-Team

## Description
My Team is an application that helps you manage your company's employees, departments, budget, and so much more! With a user-friendly node interface, you can update your database without going to the MySQL command line.

## Features 

- **Creating** 

If you've ever found someone who can meet your company's requirements, you can always add them to their new position with My Team.
Not only that, but you can also add a department and a role

- **Deleting**

Sometimes an employee decides to move to a different state and can no longer work for your company, or maybe they are heading to help another branch. In that case, you can remove that employee. Still from this app!
If you remove a manager from the database, every employee working under the supervision of that manager will have an Id set to NULL. So you can later change their managers to the next suitable candidate.

- **Updating**

Speaking of changing, let's take a look at how you can update your employee's manager. Choose the employee, then choose their manager! Yes, that's it!

- **Reading**

If you want to check employees by manager or the budget for a specific branch, you still don't need to use the MySQL command line. We have it all here!
